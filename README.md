## Tech Stack

- React 18 + Vite
- Local Storage for persistence
- bible-api.com for verse data (KJV, WEB, ASV)
- Deployable to Netlify / Vercel / GitHub Pages

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/sacred-scripture.git
cd sacred-scripture
npm install

# 2. Download the full ASV Bible (~4MB JSON)
npm run fetch-bible

# 3. Start development server
npm run dev
```

## Download Bible Data

The app can fetch verses on-demand from bible-api.com, but for best performance and offline support, download the full ASV text:

```bash
npm run fetch-bible
```

This downloads all 31,102 verses from bible-api.com and saves them to `src/data/asv.json`. The script handles rate limiting automatically — it takes about 45-60 minutes to complete.

**Note:** The ASV (American Standard Version, 1901) is in the public domain and free to distribute. It's considered one of the most literal English translations and reads more naturally than the KJV. The ESV is copyrighted by Crossway and cannot be bundled — it can be accessed via the [ESV API](https://api.esv.org/) at runtime with your own API key.

## Deploy to Netlify

### Option A: Connect GitHub repo
1. Push to GitHub
2. Go to [app.netlify.com](https://app.netlify.com)

4. Build settings are auto-detected from `netlify.toml`
5. Click "Deploy"

### Option B: Manual deploy
